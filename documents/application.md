Background
------

In my previous semester, I enrolled myself in Digital Image Processing course. During the tenure of this course I implemented filters (Gaussian, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian), edge detectors (Canny, Marr Hildreth), morphological operators (Convex hulling, Erosion, Dilation), object detectors (Generalized Hough transform, simple convolution), and seam carvers. These were implemented purely in Python, making no use of any library other than ``Numpy`` and ``Matplotlib``. This attenuated my interest in Computer Vision and I have been an active researcher since then. I have showcased these project on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/adl1995). The most interesting algorithm I implemented was [Generalized Hough Tranfrom](https://github.com/adl1995/generalised-hough-transform). I was amazed as to how something as simple as an equation of line could lead to detection of objects in images. Although my implementation was only scale invariant, I plan on extending this invariancy to orientation as well. Altough the 'HiPS to Py' project involves Computer Vision concepts at a brief level, building a visualization framework has been my interest for quite some time.

Apart from this, I have also been a PHP web developer for almost two years, and I have worked on multitude of project ranging for SaaS to e-commerce websites. I work remotely on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~018e56b8591046f889) and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/adl1995). My clients are either IT organizations or independent contractors. I have also worked on web automation and data scraping using ``Selenium`` and ``BeautifulSoup``. Although these skills are not required for this organization and have no direct links in my project, it shows that I am persistent and hard-working. The skills that I acquire are through self learning and consistency. Currently I am building an application using [Google Application Engine](https://github.com/adl1995/zoho-portal).

I started collaborating with Open Source organizations for only about a month now, and my experience has been excellent so far. The mentors have been very kind, welcoming and have provided assistance along the way. Given my background in Computer Vision and being good at problem solving, I firmly believe this prestigious organization and its users will benefit by HiPS client for Python. It would also provide me with a working ground knowledge on Astronomy.

During the tenure of this project, I hope to improve my skills with tools like  ``Jupyter``, ``Pytest``, ``Sphinx``, and ``Git``. It will also provide me with a professional level overview on how to write applications, make plans, organize projects, remotely working with other developers and design a good API.

### Abstract ###
> Design and create a Python client for Hierarchical Progressive Surveys (HiPS), allows users to view astronomical figures, similar to Google Maps. Currently, there are clients built using HiPS, such as Aladin and Aladin Lite, but they are written in Java and JavaScript, respectively. The goal of this project is that for a given World Coordinate System and image size (nx, ny), create a numpy array containing the image by fetching tiles and projecting them onto an image array. Then features like measuring fluxes and overplotting multi-wavelength data are to be added. If everything goes well, I wish to work on HiPS catalogues as well. An optional feature is to create a GUI viewer.

### Detailed description ###
Hierarchical progressive surveys (HiPS) utilizes the HEALPix framework for mapping a sphere (in our case, part of a sky) and compiles / transforms it into tiles and pixels. HiPS emphasizes on usability and thus tries to abstract the scientific details (while preserving them). This can be further built upon for statistical analysis of large datasets. For this project, a HiPS Python client is to be implemented which will enable users to view / explore astronomical figures. HiPS data is stored in the form of catalogues (TSV), or tiles (PNG, JPG, FITS). In the context of this project only tiles are to be retrieved and stitched together to get the final output. Some of the current HiPS clients include Aladin Desktop, Aladin Lite (CDS), MIZAR, ESAsky, and JUDO2.

The goal of this project would be to create a new HiPS client under ``astropy/hips``. However, this would run purely on Python. The **main dependencies** for this software are:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.5
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/)
* [Healpy](http://healpy.readthedocs.io/)

Some other **possible dependencies** for tile drawing include:
* [Reproject](http://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/ndimage.html#interpolation-functions)

#### The HEALPix framework ####

HEALPix, an acronym of 'Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization of a sphere', is a framework for discretizing high resolution data. The software is available in C, C++, Fortran90, IDL, Java, and Python. It extends a data structure (with a library), for each language. The main features provided by this software are:

  * Pixel manipulation
  * Spherical Harmonics Transforms
  * Visualization
  * Input / Output (supports FITS files)

In a nutshell, the pixelization procedure subdivides a spherical sphere in which each pixel is equidistant from the origin - meaning it covers the same surface area. This produces a HEALPix grid, whose interesting property is that pixels are distributed on lines of constant latitude. Due to this iso-latitude distribution of pixels the complexity for computing integrals over each harmonics is N<sup>1/2</sup>.

#### Pixel numbering schemes ####

HEALPix provides two numbering schemes for pixels, namely **RING scheme** and **NESTED scheme**.

Some alternative tools to HEALPix are Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM) and Tessellated Octahedral Adaptive Subdivision Transform (TOAST).

#### HEALPix coordinate system ####
HEALPix header files contain one of the following three letters, each depicting the coordinate system being used:

* C:Celestial=ICRS=RA/DEC(equatorial)=FK5 J2000
* G:Galactic
* E:Ecliptic

HiPS uses the Celestial coordinate system by default. Also, HiPS does not support Ecliptic coordinate system.

#### HiPS pixels, tiles and file structuring scheme ####
The multi-resolution representation of original images provides the basis for visualizing data in a progressive way as the pixels that are required for a given view can be accessed through pre-computed HEALPix maps, and the nested pixel numbering scheme provides a simple hierarchical indexing system that encodes pixel inheritance across different orders.

As it is cumbersome to transfer each pixel (essentially a file), HiPS scheme groups pixels in different tiles. The general relationship between tiles and pixels is that a tile with n-tile pixels along each side forms a HEALPix mesh of order of k-tile.

In HiPS, tiles store map information from HEALPix. These tiles are presented as square arrays and it is possible to store them in multiple file formats. Focusing on simplicity and usability, the description of arrays stored in files are straightforward with all the array positions being filled. The files are organized in different directories. Here, tiles are used as files and tile orders are used for grouping data in directories - all following a naming convention. For more information on the method of storing files, [this](http://aladin.unistra.fr/hips/hipsdoc.pdf) document can be viewed, written by Pierre Fernique.

#### HiPS images & catalogues ####
The way HiPS represents images is by resampling them on a HEALPix grid at the maximum desired order, say k<sup>max</sup>. Then it generates tile images for tile orders. When mosaicking / stitching images, the angular resolution is taken into account. There are various methods for filling the data region when stitching images and dealing with background difference. The k<sup>max</sup> chosen earlier determines minimum pixel size which is near to the angular pixel size or the resolution of original data.

Next important thing is whether to emphasize on ``display quality`` or ``photometric accuracy``, which depends on our use case. Image encoding can be done either in **FITS**, **PNG**, **JPG** file format. For most cases it is enough to only generate FITS and PNG files. The lowest order pixel values correspond to a large area of the sky. The HiPS indexing structure takes care of mapping correct tiles onto a display.

HiPS generation for huge amounts of data such as the Hubble Space Telescope requires planning of system growth.

The same ways a tile in HiPS image survey contains a 512x512 image, a tile catalogue contains the RA / DEC coordinates stored in a TSV file. The data is ASCII tab separated and is organized in various directories the same way as HiPS images.

##### Approach #####
For a world coordinate system and an image with dimensions ``(x * y)``, I will create a numpy array with the image by fetching tiles and projecting them onto this image array. There will be lower-level functionality, like fetching tiles.

The repository where the code will reside is already set up (https://github.com/tboch/hips). I will create Pull Requests of the code I write, which will be verified by the mentors. The project will be set up by the mentors as well.

## Benefits ##
HiPS addresses the challenge of big data in astronomy. It describes data in a multi-resolution manner, so it effectively creates an ease in its access. It can also be utilized for data sharing and interoperability. HiPS provides a means for conserving scientific details of astronomical data. MOC maps generated using HiPS facilitate the comparison of sky region between different data sets, and can be used to establish regions of intersection between multiple surveys. It helps to avoid complex queries on database through the initial first response.

Current progress
---------
I wrote a Python script which fetches HiPS tiles and displays them using ``Matplotlib``. The calculation of ``Norder``, ``Npixels``, and ``Nside`` was done using ``Healpy``. The retrieved image was then bytes decoded using the ``BytesIO`` library.

Another script I wrote retrieved a HiPS tile in JPG format and wrote it as a FITS map. This was achieved using Astropy's ``astropy.writeto`` method. The transformation / mapping of Geocentric coordinates onto a HiPS pixel was achieved using this
```python
theta, phi = hp.vec2ang(geocentric_coords)
```
Utilizing ``theta`` and ``phi`` the pixel number was found
```python
npixel = hp.ang2pix(nside, theta, phi)
```
After going through all conversions and successfully writing a FITS map, I then loaded it using ``astropy.io.fits.open`` function.

As multiple tiles have to be fetched for time efficiency, concurrency has to be achieved. So, I wrote another script utilizing Python's ``threading`` library. The elapsed time was calculated using ``time``. For fetching the tiles ``urllib``, ``grequests``, ``aiohttp``, ``asyncio`` were used.

For fetching 10 tiles, it took the following mentioned time (in seconds):
```python
Elapsed Time URLLib (without concurrency): 3.5430831909179688
Elapsed Time URLLib (with concurrency): 0.388397216796875
Elapsed Time URLLib (with aiohttp): 0.3900480270385742
Elapsed Time GRequests: 1.6238431930541992
```

Similarly, For fetching 100 tiles, it took the following mentioned time (in seconds):
```python
Elapsed Time URLLib (without concurrency): 37.7027428150177
Elapsed Time URLLib (with concurrency): 5.575664043426514
Elapsed Time URLLib (with aiohttp): 2.4697625637054443
Elapsed Time GRequests: 4.273705244064331
```

The pros of ``grequests`` is that it takes less time when large number of requests have to be sent. But, ``urllib`` (with threading) givesbetter reponse time when requests are numerous.

Using ``aiohttp`` with ``asyncio`` seems to be the best option. It's response time is almost 50% less than ``grequests``.

Apart from this, I downloaded the Aladin desktop application and examined its various functionalities. It offers a tool for enabling HEALPix grid on the currently displayed image. This helped me better understand how to the grid gets divided at different zoom levels, and the relation between order and pixel numbers.

In relation to how to write documentation and write test cases, I have familiarized myself with how to format code, tests and documentation  within the [regions](https://github.com/astropy/regions) package.

Communication
-------------
After a brief discussion with the mentors, the decision is to write progress report at the end of each outlining the following
* Amount of work done.
* Ask question(s) / assistance concerning a feature that is causing hindrance in the progress (if need be).
* Schedule for next day.
* Weekly hangouts where to assess status and make a plan for the next week (with 1 hour time investment for me to prepare a Google doc with questions and notes, and then a ~ 1 hour call with the mentors)
* Daily summary / question / next day plan emails from you in the evening, and reply with feedback from us mentors (with ~ 5 min time investment for each)

Interaction will be mainly through GitHub or Skype chat.


Mode of publishing code
-----------------------
Keeping in view the above mentioned communication structure, at least one, usually several small pull requests per week (ideally, get your work merged by the end of the week, and then you start new PRs next week)
