**Hierarchical progressive surveys (HiPS)**
===================


Overview
-
HiPS utilizes the HEALPix framework and uses it for mapping a sphere (in our case, part of a sky) and compiles / transforms it into tiles and pixels. Of course, this is in context of astronomical data. HiPS emphasizes on usability thus it tries abstract the scientific details (while preserving them). This can be further built upon for statistical analysis of large datasets.


**Introduction to HEALPix**
-
HEALPix, an acronym of 'Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization of a sphere', is a framework for discretizing high resolution data. The software is available in C, C++, Fortran90, IDL, Java and Python. It extends a data structure (with a library), for each language. The main features provided by the software are:

* Pixel manipulation
* Spherical Harmonics Transforms
* Visualization
* Input / Output (supports FITS files)

In a nutshell, the pixelization procedure subdivides a spherical sphere in which each pixel is equidistant from the origin - meaning it covers the same surface area. This produces a HEALPix grid, whose interesting property pixels are distributed on lines on constant latitude. Due to this iso-latitude distribution of pixels the complexity for computing integrals over each harmonics is N ^ (1/2).
#### **Pixel numbering schemes** ####
HEALPix provides two numbering schemes for pixels, namely **RING scheme** and **NESTED scheme**
##### **RING scheme** #####
In this schemes the pixels are counted down from north to soutch along each iso-latitude ring.
##### **NESTED scheme** #####
 This schemes arranges the pixels in 12 tree structures with respect to base-resolution pixels.

Related tools
-
In addition to HEALPix, there are several other tools available for sky tessellation, and are used by various organizations / institutes. WorldWide Telescope (WWT) uses Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM) and Tessellated Octahedral Adaptive Subdivision Transform (TOAST). Google uses a more cylindrical model.
 
**The coordinate system**
-
Before moving on to the coordinating systems used by HiPS, let's briefly go through some common measures using in astronomical studies.

##### **RA / DEC** #####
RA (right ascension) and DEC (declination) are the longitudes and latitudes of the sky. RA corresponds to east/west direction (like longitude), while Dec measures north/south directions, like latitude.

##### **WCS** #####
World coordinate system (WCS) comprises of latitude and longitude for describing a location on the Earth.

##### **FITS WCS** #####
The FITS "World Coordinate System" (WCS) standard defines keywords and usage that provide for the description of astronomical coordinate systems in a FITS image header. This is extensively used in HEALPix as it data from a FITS file.

##### **FITS** #####
Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing of scientific and other images, used by default by many sky tessellation softwares - in our case, HEALPix.

HEALPix header files can contain the following three letters, each depicting the coordinate system being used:

* **C**:Celestial=ICRS=RA/DEC(equatorial)=FK5 J2000 (default)
* **G**:Galactic
* **E**:Ecliptic (not mentioned in HiPS paper)

### **International Celestial Reference System **###

ICRS is the current standard celestial reference system adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Its **origin is at the barycenter of the Solar System**, with axes that are intended to be "fixed" with respect to space - this is referred to as International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). ICRS coordinates are approximately the same as equatorial coordinates:

### **Fifth Fundamental Catalogue **###

FK5 is a part of the "Catalogue of Fundamental Stars" which provides a series of six astrometric catalogues of high precision positional data for a small selection of stars to define a celestial reference frame. J2000 refers to the instant of 12pm (midday) on 1st January 2000. FK5, publish in 1991, added 3,117 new stars.

### **Galactic coordinate system **###

The galactic coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system in spherical coordinates, with its **origin at the Sun**, the primary direction aligned with the approximate center of the Milky Way galaxy, and the fundamental plane parallel to an approximation of the galactic plane but offset to its north. GCS has its own Galactic longitude and Galactic latitude.

### **Ecliptic coordinate system **###

A celestial coordinate system commonly used for representing the positions and orbits of Solar System objects. The system's **origin can be either the center of the Sun or the center of the Earth**, its primary direction is towards the vernal (northbound) equinox, and it has a right-handed convention.

**HiPS pixels**
-
Using the header *hips_pixel_bitpix* with the format -64, -32, 8, 16, 32, 64 (FITS convention) the pixels are stored in BITPIX code. The multi-resolution representation of the original images provides the basis for visualizing data in a progressive way as the pixels that are required for a given view can be accessed from the pre-computed HEALPix maps, and the nested pixel numbering scheme provides a simple hierarchical
indexing system that encodes pixel inheritance across the diï¬€er-
ent orders.

**HiPS tiles**
-
As it is cumbersome to transfer each pixel (essentially a file), so HiPS scheme groups pixels in different tiles. The general relationship between
the tiles and pixels is that a tile with *n*-tile pixels along each
side forms a HEALPix mesh of order of *k*-tile.


**HiPS file structuring scheme**
-
In HiPS, tiles store the map information from HEALPix. These tiles are presented as square arrays and it is possible to store them in multiple file formats. Focusing on simplicity and usability, the description of arrays stored in files are straightforward with all the array positions being filled.
The files are organized in different directories. Here, tiles are used as files and tile orders are used for group data in directories - all following a naming convention. For more information on the method of storing files, view [this](http://aladin.unistra.fr/hips/hipsdoc.pdf) document, written by *Pierre Fernique*.
